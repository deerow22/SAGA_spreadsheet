# SAGA_spreadsheet
## Note: many of the original data files were edited to remove troublesome formatting in order to open and manipulate
### Organization is as follows:
#### 1. opening fiber all spec datafile 
#### 2. opening all palomar datafiles & matching (names-only files w/ names-with-coords files)
#### 3. opening keck & arecibo datafiles
#### 4. matching palomar, keck, arecibo data tables to fiber spec datafile by coords
#### 5. collecting all matches w/in reasonable radius into one spreadsheet ---- this part isnt working well for keck & arecibo
